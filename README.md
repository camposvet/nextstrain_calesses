# nextstrain_classes2
These files are part of the learning process to run the nextstrain tutorial (available here https://github.com/grubaughlab/nextstrain_course/blob/master/nextstrain_tutorial.pdf) developmnet by Anderson Brito (https://github.com/andersonbrito ) who is kindly helping me to use this tool. I take this opportunity to thank you publicly.
For this, I use 200 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 available in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
